<p>
    Unity is a game engine, where C# code is combined with models, animations and other graphic elements to bring games to life.<br />
    <br />
    I Have written a few small games and a larger MMO game, which i used for my final report for the education "Akademi uddannelse i IT".<br />
    <br />
    The report was about implementing a design pattern called Object Pooling.<br />
    <br />
    Below a few images from the games can be seen.<br />

                    My MMO game - It was made from assets from Bitgem mainly as i really loved their style, and combined it with unity's environment, weapon from various sources and my own code.<br />
                    <br />
                    I followed a tutorial on Udemy for the most parts but added my own flair and changes to fit my game.<br />
                    Not sure it will ever get finished as I mainly used it as practise.

Great learning experience and I ended up adding a few extra things in the end, and had great fun doing it. It was a survival game where waves of mobs runs towards you and you had to survive as long as possible.</p></td>
